Building the ioMemory VSL (Driver) from Source
----------------------------------------------

The iomemory-vsl4 driver is distributed as a source package. Source packages from
other distributions are not guaranteed to work.

You need to build the driver from a source package that corresponds to your
OS kernel.

To determine what kernel version is running on your system, use the
following command:

    $ uname -r

Note: Installation commands require administrator privileges. Log in as
      root or use sudo to run the install.

Note: Make sure you have the right development download for your kernel.
      The running kernel version can be found by running "uname -r" and the
      module directory would then be found like this:

          $ ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)

      Kernel development sources are found, on most distributions, by
      symlinks in this module directory.  These symlinks are "source" and
      "build" and should resolve to appropriate directories.

1. Download current driver source and support packages from
   http://support.fusionio.com

   Note: The exact source package to download depends on your operating
         system, but it is either an .rpm package (for operating systems
         that use .rpm packages) or a tar installation package (for
         anything else).  Fortunately the tar files are not distribution
         specific and can be built on any supported distribution.

2. Change directory to wherever you downloaded the source package.

3. Follow the instructions below in either Building from an .rpm Source
   Package or Building from a Debian Source Package to create an
   installation package tailored to your needs.


Building a .rpm Installation Package
------------------------------------

To build a .rpm installation package:

1. Remove prior versions of the ioDrive driver .rpm and utilities:

       $ rpm -qa 'iomemory-vsl*'
       $ rpm -qa 'fio-*'
       $ rpm -e <packages listed in previous commands>

2. Install the prerequisite files for your kernel version.

   On CentOS 5 or RHEL 5, you need kernel-devel, kernel-headers, (which
   may already be in the default OS installation) and GCC4.

       $ yum install kernel-devel kernel-headers gcc rsync

3. To build an .rpm installation package for the current kernel from a
   .src.rpm, run this command:

       $ rpmbuild --rebuild iomemory-vsl4-4.3.7.1205-1.src.rpm

   When using a .src.rpm source package for a non-running kernel, run this
   command:

       $ rpmbuild --rebuild --define 'rpm_kernel_version 2.6.24.4-64.fc8-x86_64' iomemory-vsl4-4.3.7.1205-1.src.rpm

   The new .rpm package is located in a directory that is indicated in the
   output from the rpmbuild command.  To find it, look for the "Wrote:"
   line. In the following example, the .rpm packages are located in the
   /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/x86_64/ directory.  See the sample "rpmbuild"
   output below:

       ...
       Processing files: iomemory-vsl4-source-4.3.7.1205-1
       Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1
       Obsoletes: iodrive-driver-source
       Checking for unpackaged file(s): /usr/lib/rpm/check-files /var/tmp/iomemory-vsl4-4.3.7.1205-root
       Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/x86_64/iomemory-vsl4-2.6.18-128.el5-4.3.7.1205-1.x86_64.rpm
       Wrote: /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/x86_64/iomemory-vsl4-source-4.3.7.1205-1.x86_64.rpm

   Make a note of the .rpm location; you will need this information for the installation.

   Note: A .rpm installation package can also be built from a .tar.gz or
         .tar.bz2 file using similar rpmbuild commands to those listed
         above by using "-ta" instead of "--rebuild":

             $ rpmbuild -ta iomemory-vsl4_4.3.7.1205-1.tar.gz

4. Install the generated driver in conjunction with any additional files
   (fio-util, fio-firmware, etc.) that have been downloaded from
   http://support.fusionio.com .


Building a Debian Installation Package
--------------------------------------

To build a Debian installation package:

1. Install the prerequisites for building the iomemory-vsl4 source driver
   package (a complete list of dependencies are listed by the
   "Build-Depends" tag in the debian/control file inside the tar):

       $ sudo apt-get install gcc fakeroot build-essential debhelper linux-headers-$(uname --r) rsync

   You can also install packages separately by running this command:

       $ sudo apt-get install gcc rsync

2. Download the driver source file for your target operating system at
   http://support.fusionio.com

3. Unpack the driver source file:

       $ tar zxvf iomemory-vsl4_4.3.7.1205-1.tar.gz

4. Change to the directory created in the previous step:

       $ cd iomemory-vsl4-4.3.7.1205

5. Begin the driver rebuild:

       $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b

   You can also build the driver as a root user, though this is not recommended:

       $ sudo dpkg-buildpackage

   Alternatively "debuild" can be used:

       $ debuild

6. The new .deb package is located in the parent directory.

   Note: A failure of any of these builds may be due to required packages
         missing from the system. The output from the failed command
         informs you of which packages are missing. Try installing any
         missing packages and then repeating the build process.


7. Install the generated driver in conjunction with any additional files
   (fio-util, fio-firmware, etc.) that have been downloaded from
   http://support.fusionio.com .


Building and Installing for Non-deb and Non-rpm Based Systems
-------------------------------------------------------------

The ioMemory VSL driver can be built and installed on systems without using
RPM and .deb packaging.  A .tar file is available from
http://support.fusionio.com for manually unpacking, building and
installing.

1. Ensure that kernel development files are installed.

2. Download the driver source .tar.gz file from http://support.fusionio.com .

3. Unpack the driver source file:

       $ tar zxvf iomemory-vsl4_4.3.7.1205-1.tar.gz

   Change directory into the unpacked source:

       $ cd iomemory-vsl4-4.3.7.1205/root/usr/src/fio/iomemory-vsl4

4. Build the driver:

   If the target kernel is the currently running kernel:

       $ make modules

   If the target kernel is not running then indicate the target kernel
   using KERNELVER:

       $ make KERNELVER=2.6.36-5.2 modules

5. Install the driver:

       $ make modules_install

   Or

       $ make KERNELVER=2.6.36-5.2 modules_install

For more information, see the User Guide.
